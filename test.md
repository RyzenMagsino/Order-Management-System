# Order Management System Documentation

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Project Context
The client currently faces significant challenges in tracking ingredients for their products. Their existing process requires manually listing ingredients for each new order, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. This repetitive task creates inefficiencies in their order management process and increases the risk of inconsistencies in product preparation.

### 1.2 Purpose and Description
The Order Management System (OMS) is specifically designed to solve the client's ingredient tracking problems. The system will maintain a centralized database of products and their associated ingredients, eliminating the need to re-list ingredients for each order. This solution will streamline the order process and ensure consistency in product preparation. The system provides a user-friendly interface with five main components. First, it implements a secure login system with robust authentication mechanisms. Second, it features a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring sales and pending orders. Third, it includes a complete order management interface that supports all CRUD operations. Fourth, it provides a detailed transaction tracking system for monitoring all business activities. Finally, it includes profile management capabilities with secure password change functionality.

### 1.3 Objectives
The development of this Order Management System is driven by several key objectives aimed at improving the client's business operations. The primary goal is to eliminate the redundant process of ingredient listing for each new order by maintaining a centralized product and ingredient database. The system aims to provide accurate and efficient tracking of ingredients for each product, ensuring consistency in preparation and reducing errors. Through its comprehensive dashboard, the system enables efficient monitoring of sales performance with daily, weekly, and monthly views, allowing for better business insights. A crucial feature is the ability to track pending orders within a 3-day window, ensuring timely fulfillment and improved customer satisfaction. The system maintains secure user authentication and profile management, protecting sensitive business data. Additionally, it streamlines the entire order management process through complete CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete orders efficiently.

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations
The scope of this Order Management System encompasses several key functionalities designed to address the client's specific needs. At its core, the system implements a secure user authentication system, allowing admin-level access through a dedicated login interface. The main dashboard, accessible through index.html, serves as the central hub for business operations, featuring comprehensive monthly and weekly sales views, along with a specialized pending orders tracking system that maintains visibility for a three-day window. The order management component provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling complete control over order processing and management. The system also includes a robust transaction history viewing system for monitoring all business transactions. Additionally, the profile management functionality allows users to maintain their account security through password management features.

## Chapter 2: System Analysis

### 2.1 Development Model
The development of this system follows a structured agile methodology implementation, emphasizing flexibility and iterative progress. Through careful sprint planning and execution, the development team maintains a steady pace while adapting to changing requirements. The iterative development approach allows for continuous improvement and refinement of features based on feedback and testing results.

### 2.2 Development Approach
The development strategy is divided into frontend and backend components. The frontend development utilizes modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and responsive user interface. Special attention is given to implementing responsive design principles, ensuring the system works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. The user interface components are carefully crafted to provide an optimal user experience.

The backend development focuses on creating a robust server architecture that can efficiently handle all system operations. The database design is optimized for storing and retrieving product and ingredient information, while the API implementation ensures smooth communication between the frontend and backend components.

### 2.3 Schedule and Timeline
The project follows a structured 10-week development timeline, organized into three main phases. Below is a detailed Gantt chart representation of the project schedule:

### 2.4 Project Teams and Responsibilities
The project team consists of several key roles working in coordination to ensure successful system delivery. The Project Manager oversees the entire development process, ensuring timely delivery and quality standards. Frontend Developers focus on creating the user interface and implementing client-side functionality. Backend Developers handle server-side logic and database operations. QA Engineers ensure system quality through comprehensive testing, while the Documentation Team maintains detailed project documentation throughout the development lifecycle.
